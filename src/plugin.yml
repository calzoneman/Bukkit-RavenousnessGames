    RavenousnessGames assists server admins who wish to run
    Hunger-Games-style survival competitions. All online players are
    classified as either competitors or admins. Competitors are further
    classified as either alive or dead. Dead competitors are prevented
    from making modifications to the world, made invisible, and given
    the ability to fly. Dead competitors can optionally be given
    'sponsor' status to allow them to modify the world.
